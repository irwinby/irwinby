Hi ğŸ‘‹, I am a passionate software engineer with experience building distributed systems. I enjoy building software solutions using software design principles such as clean architecture, domain-driven design and test-driven development. I improve my software engineering skills by practicing and correcting my mistakes in each new iteration. This is my way to becoming a true expert. ğŸ‘€
